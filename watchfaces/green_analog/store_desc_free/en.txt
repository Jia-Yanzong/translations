Classic, minimal and highly customizable watchface. With over 100 data points, many AOD options and low battery usage, the perfect watch face to wear in style.


⭐️ Free vs Pro ⭐️
This watchface is available at no cost with all basic functions. Premium features (marked with [*]) require a Pro Key to unlock. You can purchase a Pro Key here:  https://apps.garmin.com/apps/87860c9d-4214-4b7c-9770-f2e0cf4ee78c

⭐️ MIPS Devices (Fenix 7, Enduro, Forerunner 255, etc) ⭐️
This watchface is fully optimized for MIPS, but colors can look different as in most pictures, as these are taken on an Amoled device. You can find all the build in themes here: https://watchface.io/green_analog/themes
